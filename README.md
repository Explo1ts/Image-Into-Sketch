#Image-to-Sketch - Made By Exploits

Overview:

The Image-to-Sketch tool is a Python-based script that converts any input image into a pencil sketch-style image. Using OpenCV for image processing, it applies grayscale conversion, inversion, Gaussian blur, and blending techniques to create realistic sketches. This tool is ideal for photographers, designers, or anyone who wants to transform their photos into artistic sketches easily.

Features:

Realistic Sketch Conversion: Transform your images into pencil sketches with accurate shading.

Easy-to-Use: Simply provide the image path, and the script generates a sketch automatically.

Custom Output: Save the generated sketch to a file of your choice.

Preview Functionality: View both the original and sketch images side by side using a simple GUI window.

No Internet Required: Fully offline image processing using OpenCV.
